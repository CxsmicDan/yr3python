#C.R.I.B.S is a way to remember all the data types
#you can "cast" for data types
#like this:
name = str(input("enter name"))
#str means we want the data as a string
age = int(input("enter age"))
#int means we want a integer
price = float(input("enter price of a freddo"))
#float means we want a realfloat

#this is called casting
