#user enters e.g. 3
#then code displays "For house 1"
#"How many walls to be painted?"
#user enters e.g.2
#"What colour is it?" <-this is repeated for each wall
#HINT: use a loop in a loop

housesbooked = int(input("how many houses are booked in?>>>"))
for i in range(1,housesbooked+1):
  print("for house", i)
  painted = int(input("how many wall/s to be painted"))
  for i in range(1, painted+1):
    print("for wall", i)
    colour = str(input("what colour will it be?>>>"))
    print("got it, house" , i)
    print("will have ", painted , "wall/s")
    print("wall", i)
    print("will be" , colour)
